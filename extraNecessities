Key Points:
FMOD: Handles 3D sound positioning and listener attributes.
SDL: Renders a simple overlay with a line pointing to the sound direction.
Mapping: Converts 3D sound positions to 2D screen coordinates.
Prerequisites:
Install FMOD and SDL2 development libraries.
Link FMOD and SDL2 in your build system.
Compilation:
On Windows, use a compiler like g++ or Visual Studio. For example, with g++:

g++ main.cpp -o SoundOverlay -lSDL2 -lfmod

Follow these steps to install FMOD and SDL2 on a Windows machine.

Install SDL2:
Download the SDL2 development libraries for Windows from the SDL2 website.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your system.
Copy the include folder to your project directory or configure your compiler to include it.
Copy the lib folder (specific to your compiler, e.g., lib/x64 for 64-bit MinGW) to your project directory or configure your linker to include it.
Place the SDL2.dll file (from the lib folder) in the same directory as your compiled executable.

Install FMOD:
Download the FMOD Studio API for Windows from the FMOD website.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your system.
Copy the api/core/inc folder to your project directory or configure your compiler to include it.
Copy the appropriate lib folder (e.g., api/core/lib/x64 for 64-bit MinGW) to your project directory or configure your linker to include it.
Place the fmod.dll file (from the api/core/lib folder) in the same directory as your compiled executable.
Configure Your Build System:
Add the include paths for SDL2 and FMOD to your compiler's include directories.
Add the library paths for SDL2 and FMOD to your linker's library directories.
Link against the required libraries (e.g., SDL2.lib and fmod_vc.lib for Visual Studio or -lSDL2 and -lfmod for MinGW). Use the Search marketplace command to find extensions that might help with SDL2 or FMOD development.

Get a copy of the SDL source, you can clone the repo, or download the "Source Code" asset from the latest release.
If you've downloaded a release, make sure to extract the contents somewhere you can find it.
Create a new project in Visual Studio, using the C++ Empty Project template
Add hello.c to the Source Files
Right click the solution, select add an existing project, navigate to VisualC/SDL from within the source you cloned or downloaded above and add SDL.vcxproj
Select your main project and go to Project -> Add -> Reference and select SDL3
Select your main project and go to Project -> Properties, set the filter at the top to "All Configurations" and "All Platforms", select C/C++ -> General and add the SDL include directory to "Additional Include Directories"
Build and run!
